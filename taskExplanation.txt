You are given a building floor map like so:
WWWWWWWWWWWWW
W  E  W  E  W
W     W     W
W           W
W     W     W
W  E  W   E W
WWWWWWWWWWWWW
W - wall
E - employee
[SPACE] - empty space
You need to find the best empty space to put a kitchen in.
The kitchen needs to be located in the empty space for which the sum of distances
to all employees is minimal.
The distance from an empty space to an employee is the shortest path from the employee
to the empty space.
Employees can only walk in north, south, east or west directions (no diagonals).
Employees cannot walk through walls.
Write a program that receives as input a file with the floor
plan and outputs the best kitchen location.
If the floor plan does not allow for a kitchen (for example if the floor
plan does not allow some employees to reach some spaces) then state that it is so.
